This project depends on the following libraries:
* DallasTemperature 3.7.2
* MsTimer2 0.6
* OneWire 2.1
* SD
   * When compiling in Eclipse, you may need to change the paths in the
     SD/utility/SdFile.cpp and SD/utility/SdVolume.cpp to use double quotes
     rather than angle brackets to refer to the SDFat.h include.
